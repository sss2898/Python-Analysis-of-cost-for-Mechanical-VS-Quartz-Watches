# Python-Analysis-of-cost-for-Mechanical-VS-Quartz-Watches

*Project Overview

This project explores the pricing trends of Mechanical (Manual Winding, Automatic) and Quartz watches to determine whether mechanical watches are significantly more expensive than their quartz counterparts. Through data-driven insights, we analyze price distributions, historical trends, and brand-specific variations.

Hypothesis

Mechanical watches (Manual Winding & Automatic) are more expensive than Quartz watches due to their craftsmanship, exclusivity, and historical significance.

Dataset Details

File Name: Watches.csv

Columns in Dataset:

brand - Watch brand

model - Model name

price - Price of the watch (in USD)

mvmt - Movement type (Automatic, Quartz, Manual Winding)

yop - Year of Production

condition - Condition of the watch (New, Pre-owned, Unworn)

Key Visualizations & Insights

1. Price Distribution by Movement Type (Box Plot)

Finding: Manual winding watches have the highest median price, followed by automatic watches, while quartz watches remain the most affordable.

Reason: Mechanical watches require high craftsmanship and limited production, making them more exclusive.

2. Average Price by Movement Type (Bar Chart)

Finding: The average price of Manual Winding and Automatic watches is significantly higher than Quartz watches.

Reason: Quartz watches are mass-produced, whereas mechanical watches involve intricate design and higher production costs.

3. Price Distribution Across All Watches (Histogram)

Finding: Quartz watches mainly fall under $500-$5,000, while automatic and manual winding watches span a much wider price range.

Reason: Mechanical watches are valued as collector's items and are often priced at premium levels.

4. Historical Trends: How Prices Have Changed Over Time (Line Chart)

Finding: Quartz watches initially had high prices when the technology was new, but over time, mechanical watches dominated the luxury market.

Reason: As quartz watch production scaled, prices dropped, while the exclusivity of mechanical watches maintained their high value.

5. Luxury Brands and Price Variations (Grouped Bar Chart)

Finding: Across luxury brands, mechanical watches (manual & automatic) consistently have higher prices compared to quartz models.

Reason: Brands like Patek Philippe, Audemars Piguet, and A. Lange & Söhne focus on heritage and mechanical expertise, making these watches highly sought after.

Conclusion

✔ Mechanical watches (Manual Winding & Automatic) are indeed more expensive than Quartz watches.
✔ Their high value is driven by craftsmanship, exclusivity, and historical significance.
✔ Quartz watches are more affordable and practical, yet enthusiasts continue to prefer mechanical timepieces.
